1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When I want to be able to easily share my work or collaborate with others. 
- It serves as a good backup.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- To have more control.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
 When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a copy of another's respository on github, without pulling the code
down to your own computer. It can be done when one doesn't have permission
to modify the original repository.

A clone is a copy of a repository to your local computer. It can be used when
you're getting a copy of a repository that you have permission to modify - your own
repository or another which you've been added as a collaborator.

A branch is a group of commits with a name. When a branch is created, it contains
all the commits up till the recent commit. It can be used to implement new features
or create bug fixes, etc.
