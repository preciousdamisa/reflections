1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When I want to be able to easily share my work or collaborate with others. 
- It serves as a good backup.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- To have more control.
